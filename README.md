# Orpheus-And-Eurydice
 Unity VR Project about the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice
 Made in Unity 6 (6000.0.30f1)


 I created an experience where you are playing as Orpheus trying to get Eurydice back from the Underworld. This starts right after Hades and Persephone agree to let you try, all you need to do is get to the end without looking back. The main interaction is walking forward, and if you happen to look back then Eurydice fades away, lost. It is checked by comparing the headset’s angle with the path behind you. You’re also able to pick up the instructions in the first, safe room, where you can look around without issue. If you fail, you’re able to try again. I wanted to add an ending where you’re able to get her out, so if you make it to the end without being tempted and looking back then you’re all set. I used Unity 6 with the Unity XR Interaction Toolkit. For the environment and audio, I used a variety of free Unity Store Assets, linked in this readme. I also used ProBuilder to quickly make new 3D objects.

While working on this experience, one of the tougher parts was deciding what to make. I played around with a few other ideas (lego building, arranging a room, etc) before landing on this one. I wanted something that had a clear objective and interaction, while having a bit of story that didn’t need a lot of voice acting to carry it. When building out the environment for the Underworld, I wanted to have it feel dark but not scary. I tweaked the lighting settings throughout the scene to fit that mood, and baked the lighting because realtime light calculations can drive down performance. I also layered planes with growing transparency to mimic fog/water below the player.
